preq (prounounced "preek") is a free and open community-driven reliability problem detector

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/demo.gif" alt="preq demo" width="700">
</p>

Use **preq** to:

- detect the latest bugs, misconfigurations, anti-patterns, and known issues from a community of practitioners
- provide engineers, on-call support, and SRE agents with impact and community recommended mitigations
- hunt for new problems in distributed systems

preq is powered by [Common Reliability Enumerations (CREs)](https://github.com/prequel-dev/cre) that are contributed by the community and Prequel's Reliability Research Team. Reliability intelligence helps teams see a broad range of problems earlier, so they can prioritize, pinpoint, and reduce the risk of outages.



## Install preq

### Standalone Binary Distributions

Official binary distributions are available at [latest release](https://github.com/prequel-dev/preq/releases) for Linux (amd64), macOS (amd64 and arm64), and Windows (amd64). All macOS binaries are signed and notarized. No configuration is necessary to start using preq.

### Kubernetes

You can also install preq as a Krew plugin:

```bash
kubectl krew install preq
```

See https://docs.prequel.dev/install for more information.

## Quick Usage

**Step 1**: Install and run the demo service

```bash
curl -sL "$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/prequel-dev/preq-demo-app/releases/latest \
  | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | test("demo-linux-amd64$")) .browser_download_url')" \
  -o demo && chmod +x demo && ./demo > preq-demo.log 2>&1
```
**Step 2**: Trigger a problem
```bash
curl -sL "$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/prequel-dev/preq-demo-app/releases/latest \
  | jq -r '.assets[] | select(.name | test("demo-linux-amd64$")) .browser_download_url')" \
  -o demo && chmod +x demo && ./demo > preq-demo.log 2>&1
```
**Step 3**: Detect the problem
```bash
cat preq-demo.log | preq -o -
```
You’ll see a detection printed with the corresponding CRE ID, severity, and suggested mitigation.

```bash
Parsing rules           done! [3 rules in 3ms; 433 rules/s]
Problems detected       done! [1 in 7ms; 144/s]

```
See our running preq guide for full walkthrough, including writing your own rules: https://docs.prequel.dev/running

## Architecture Overview

<img alt="architecture image">

preq is powered by a rules engine that performs distributed matching and correlation of sequences of events across logs, metrics, traces, and other data sources to detect reliability problems. CREs provides accurate and timely context for a human or SRE agent to take action on problems.

## Example CRE
Below is simple rule that looks for a sequence of events in a single log source over a window of time along with a negative condition (an event that should not occur during the window).

```yaml title="cre-2024-0007.yaml" showLineNumbers
cre:
  id: CRE-2024-0007
  severity: 0
  title: RabbitMQ Mnesia overloaded recovering persistent queues
  category: message-queue-problems
  author: Prequel
  description: |
    - The RabbitMQ cluster is processing a large number of persistent mirrored queues at boot. 
  cause: |
    - The Erlang process, Mnesia, is overloaded while recovering persistent queues on boot. 
  impact: |
    - RabbitMQ is unable to process any new messages and can cause outages in consumers and producers.
  tags: 
    - cre-2024-0007
    - known-problem
    - rabbitmq
  mitigation: |
    - Adjusting mirroring policies to limit the number of mirrored queues
    - Remove high-availability policies from queues
    - Add additional CPU resources and restart the RabbitMQ cluster
    - Use [lazy queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/lazy-queues) to avoid incurring the costs of writing data to disk

    order:
      - regex: Discarding message(.+)in an old incarnation(.+)of this node
      - Mnesia is overloaded
    negate:
      - SIGTERM received - shutting down
```

## Automated Actions using preq
See https://docs.prequel.dev/running#automated-runbooks for examples of how to setup automated runbooks when a CRE is detected and trigger actions:
- Slack Notifications
- Jira Issue Creation
- Runbook executables
- CronJobs

## Data sources other than `stdin`

preq works on any timestamped data source, not just stdin.
You can define multiple sources (e.g., app logs, system logs, metrics dumps) in a YAML template and let preq automatically map CRE rules to the right data.

Learn more about data sources here: https://docs.prequel.dev/data-sources

## Community
We’re building an open reliability detection community nd we’d love you to join!

- [Slack](https://inviter.co/prequel): Ask questions, share detections, propose new CREs. 

- [Playground](https://play.prequel.dev/): Try rules in your browser with WebAssembly, no data leaves your machine.

- [Docs](https://docs.prequel.dev): Explore the documentation to learn how to install, run, automate, and write CREs.

- [CRE Repository](https://github.com/prequel-dev/cre): Contribute new community detection rules and help the reliability community grow.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds: bug fixes, docs, new CRE rules, or feature ideas.

See the contribution guide for more details: https://docs.prequel.dev/cres/contributing
